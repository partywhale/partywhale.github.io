                        Hi, I’m James Watkins. I’m originally from Vancouver, British Columbia, <s>but I currently live on Vancouver Island</s> and after seven or so years 
                        I've somehow found my way back here (my heart's still on the Island, though).
                        I studied sociology at the University of Victoria where I completed a B.A. (Hons) and M.A. 
                        Most of my projects were oriented toward gerontology and demography, but I’m always looking to apply my skills and expertise elsewhere!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have many years experience using Stata, SAS, and SPSS for statistical analysis. 
                        I dabble in Python, JavaScript, and R for hobbyist applications (some of which you might find on this site), but I'm increasingly using these languages
                        for serious analytic and visualization work, too. 
                        I like to use Plotly to make pretty (and sometimes interactive) visualizations&mdash;or Datawrapper if I'm feeling lazy. 
                        I like to mess around with GIS, but I consider myself a newbie on that front. 
                        I also help my 5-year-old daughter create animations using Scratch Jr (mostly fish races). We even built a Discord bot together using JavaScript!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the hardware side, I typically use the Arduino and Raspbery Pi platforms for electronics and IoT projects. 
                        I like to take things apart and learn about them, or scavenge spare parts. 
                        Recently I’ve experimented with LCD transparency, electrochromic materials, and image projection onto glass. 
                        I build and maintain the desktop computers in my household. 
                        My homelab doesn’t consist of much at the moment: 
                        ‘production’ includes Plex, game servers, and some Ubiquiti network gear; 
                        ‘development’ consists of some old enterprise network equipment, a Raspberry Pi, and an old laptop. 
                        But hey, I’ll get there eventually.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also do some amateur astronomy. 
                        In the summer of 2018 I saw Jupiter’s four visible moons (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto) and Saturn’s rings with my own eyes for the first time. 
                        I’m currently using a pair of binoculars and a Celestron AstroMaster 130 Newtonian reflector telescope. 
                        I’m beginning to dabble in astrophotography, but I’m not very good at it yet. 
                        I like to keep up with dwarf planet and exoplanet news, and I chart nearby star systems in 3D.

                        My favourite authors include J. R. R. Tolkien, Terry Pratchett, and Ursula K. Le Guin. <br>
                        My favourite poets are Siegfried Sassoon and Robert Graves. <br>
                        My favourite social theorists are Zygmunt Bauman and Pierre Bourdieu.

                        About this site
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        This site was originally conceived in 2015, but went offline after a year - I simply felt I didn’t have much use for a permanent online presence and had better things to be doing (e.g. grad school). 
                        Instead, when I felt like sharing a project or write-up, I’d inundate a small Discord community of interested people with messages. 
                        At some point I realized that Discord is not a great way to store work permanently. Thus, this site.

                        <a href="https://bulma.io/">Bulma CSS</a>, and a little <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> & vanilla JavaScript to soften the edges. <br> 
                        I use the <a href="https://katex.org/">KaTeX JavaScript library</a> for LaTeX math typesetting. <br>
                        I use <a href="https://highlightjs.org/">highlight.js</a> for syntax highlighting in code snippets. <br>
