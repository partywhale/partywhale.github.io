### Who am I?
I'm James. Sociologist and demographer by trade. I'm currently in the process of completing my Master's degree. My thesis examines the health and well-being outcomes of caregivers who provide emotional support in high-stress situations. But that's not all I do!

I like to mess around with microcontrollers, single-board computers, and other electronics. I'm an amateur astronomer (currently using a Celestron AstroMaster 130). I'm interested in [homelabbing](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/) and [self-hosting](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/) to better understand system administration. I like to garden, and make pizza by hand. And I write a [demography blog](http://probablylikely.com/) about some of the quirkier issues.

My nose is often burried in a book (currently reading the entire Discworld series), and my hands are usually occupied by a Rubik's Cube or other twisty-puzzle (my best 3x3 time is 29.83 seconds). Frequently I'm doing any of the things listed on this site with my 3-year-old daughter, who always needs to know 'why?'.

This website is a place for me to share... things. Maybe I'm documenting an electronics project. Maybe I want to share a Python script. Or maybe there's just a recipe I don't want to forget.
