Animal Crossing: New Horizons came out on March 20, 2020. This game has an economic mechanic called the "Stalk Market". Every Sunday, a character shows up on your island selling turnips. The price of these turnips is randomized and unique to each player's island; on March 22 (the first possible date turnips were available), my turnip buy price was 92 Bells (Bells is the usual Animal Crossing currency). Monday through Saturday, you can sell these turnips back to the regular island vendor, but the price varies: each day has a random price in the morning (8:00-11:59) and another price in the afternoon (12:00-21:59). The goal is to sell back the turnips at a favourble rate, earning profit and avoiding losses. You can't hold out too long, because the turnips will go rotten on the next Sunday.

This is the first time I've played an Animal Crossing game. I've heard a lot about how the Stalk Market worked in previous games. Some people maintain that Tuesdays usually have the best price. Others have found recognizable drop and spike patterns, and claim that paying attention to these can help you minimize losses and maximize earnings. I'm tracking my weekly buy and twice-daily sell prices to find out if there's any truth to these assertions, and hopefully contribute to our knowledge of turnip economics. But also, mostly, to make a buttload of Bells.

### Price Trends
This section will probably get bigger as I collect more data.

### Buys and Sells
I don't really have anything to post here yet. I bought 50 turnips at 92 Bells per (4,600 Bells total) on March 22, and sold them all at 147 Bells per (7,350 Bells total) on March 23 AM, making a 2,750 Bell profit (160% increase).
