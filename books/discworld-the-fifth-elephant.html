                        A few days ago Sam Vimes was a copper. An important copper, true - chief of police - but still, at his core, a policeman. 
                        But today he is an ambassador - to the mysterious, fat-rich country of Uberwald. Today Sam Vimes is also a man on the run.

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Vimes had once discussed the Ephebian idea of ‘democracy’ with Carrot, and had been rather interested in the idea that everyone had a vote until he found out that while he, Vimes, would have a vote, there was no way in the rules that anyone could prevent Nobby Nobs from having one as well. Vimes could see the flaw there straight away.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>He took his hands off the oars and pulled in the mooring rope. If I make a couple of loops, he thought, I can strap the axe onto my back. He had a mental picture of what could happen to a man who plunged into the cauldron below a waterfall with a sharp piece of metal attached to his body.<br />
                        GOOD MORNING.<br />
                        Vimes blinked. A tall dark robed figure was now sitting in the boat.<br />
                        ‘Are you Death?’<br />
                        IT’S THE SCYTHE, ISN’T IT? PEOPLE ALWAYS NOTICE THE SCYTHE.<br />
                        ‘I’m going to die?’<br />
                        POSSIBLY.<br />
                        ‘Possibly? You turn up when people are possibly going to die?’<br />
                        OH YES. IT’S QUITE THE NEW THING. IT’S BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE.<br />
                        ‘What’s that?’<br />
                        I’M NOT SURE.<br />
                        ‘That’s very helpful.’</p>
