                        William de Worde is the accidental editor of the Discworld’s first newspaper. 
                        New printing technology means that words just won’t obediently stay nailed down like usual. 
                        There’s a very real threat of news getting out there.
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>‘And these are your reasons, my lord?’<br />
                        ‘Do you think I have others?’ said Lord Vetinari. ‘My motives, as ever, are entirely transparent.’<br />
                        Hughnon reflected that ‘entirely transparent’ meant either that you could see right through them or that you couldn’t see them at all.</p>

                        The Death of Rats looked up from the feast of the potato. SQUEAK, he said.<br />
                        Death waved a hand dismissively. WELL, YES, OBVIOUSLY ME, he said. I JUST WONDERED IF THERE WAS ANYONE ELSE.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                      
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>William groaned. It was Vimes. Worse, he was smiling, in a humourless predatory way.<br />
                        ‘Ah, Mr de Worde,’ he said, stepping inside. ‘There are several thousand dogs stampeding through the city at the moment. This is an interesting fact, isn’t it?’<br />
                        He leaned against the wall and produced a cigar. ‘Well, I <em>say</em> dogs,’ he said, striking a match on Goodmountain’s helmet. ‘<em>Mostly</em> dogs, perhaps I <em>should</em> say. Some cats. More cats now, in fact, ‘cos, hah, there’s nothing like a, yes, a tidal wave of dogs, fighting and biting and howling, to sort of, how can I put it, give a city a certain… busyness. Especially underfoot, because - did I mention it? - they’re very <em>nervous</em> dogs too. Oh, and did I mention cattle?’ he went on, conversationally. ‘You know how it is, market day and so on, people are driving the cows and, my goodness, around the corner comes a wall of wailing dogs… Oh, and I forgot about the sheep. And the chickens, although I imagine there’s not much left of the chickens now…’<br />
                        He stared at William. ‘Anything you feel you want to tell me?’ he said.</p>
