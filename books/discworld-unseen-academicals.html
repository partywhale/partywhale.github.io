                        Football has come to the ancient city of Ankh-Morpork. 
                        And now, the wizards of Unseen University must win a football match, without using magic, so they’re in the mood for trying anything else. 
                        This is not going to be a gentleman’s game.

                        ‘Because if anyone has poisoned our Librarian,’ said Ridcully, ‘then, although I am not, by nature, a vindictive man, I will see to it that this university hunts down the poisoner by every thaumic, mystic and occult means available and makes the rest of their life not only as horrible as they can imagine it, but as horrible as I can imagine it. And you can depend on it, gentlemen, that I have already started work on it.’</p>
