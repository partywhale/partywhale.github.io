                        He’s been a legend in his own lifetime. He can remember the great days of high adventure. 
                        He can remember when a hero didn’t have to worry about fences and lawyers and civilisation. 
                        He can remember when people didn’t tell you off for killing dragons. But he can’t always remember, these days, where he put his teeth. 
                        He’s really not happy about that bit. 
                        So now, with his ancient sword and his new walking stick and his old friends - and they’re very old friends - Cohen the Barbarian is going on one final quest.
