                        Maurice, a streewise tomcat, has the perfect money-making scam. 
                        Everyone knows the stories about rats and pipers, and Maurice has a stupid-looking kid with a pipe, and his very own plague of rats - strangely educated rats… 
                        But in Bad Blintz, the little con suddenly goes down the drain. For someone there is playing a different tune and now the rats must learn a new word. 
                        Evil. It’s not a game any more. It’s a rat-eat-rat world. And that might only be the start…
