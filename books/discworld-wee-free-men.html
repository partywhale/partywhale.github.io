                        Armed only with a frying pan and her common sense, Tiffany Aching, a young witch-to-be, is all that stands between the monsters of Fairyland 
                        and the warm, green Chalk country that is her home.

                        <p>‘Witches are naturally nosy,’ said Miss Tick, standing up. ‘Well, I must go. I hope we shall meet again. I will give you some free advice, though.’<br />
                        ‘Will it cost me anything?’<br />
                        ‘What? I just said it was free!’ said Miss Tick.<br />
                        ‘Yes, but my father said that free advice often turns out to be expensive,’ said Tiffany.<br />
                        Miss Tick sniffed. ‘You could say this advice is priceless,’ she said, ‘Are you listening?’<br />
                        ‘Yes,’ said Tiffany.<br />
                        ‘Good. Now… if you trust in yourself…’<br />
                        ‘Yes?’<br />
                        ‘…and believe in your dreams…’<br />
                        ‘Yes?’<br />
                        ‘…and follow your star…’ Miss Tick went on.<br />
                        ‘Yes?’<br />
                        ‘…you’ll still be beaten by people who spent their time working hard and learning things and weren’t so lazy. Goodbye.’</p>
