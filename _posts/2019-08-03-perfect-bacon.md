I keep forgetting at what temperature and for how long to cook bacon.

Let bacon thaw in advance. Frozen bacon is not fun to work with.  
Preheat oven on Convection Bake at 400F.  
Lay a sheet of parchment on a dark cookie sheet (dark bakes faster). Let it overlap the side of the sheet, so bacon grease is contained (and easy to clean up later).  
Lay bacon on pan in a single layer. Flip every second piece to fit more on, if necessary.  
Bake for 10 minutes.  
Check bacon. At 10 minutes it's usually still pretty chewy. If you want it crispier, leave it in the oven and check it every 1-2 minutes.  

12-13 minutes is usually an ideal half-chewy half-crispy state for BLTs.
