A GitHub Pages website

That's pretty much it. This is where my personal website is hosted.  
This site is built with pure HTML (was formerly Jekyll on Ruby).  
It uses [Bulma CSS](https://bulma.io/) for style and some [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) to soften the edges.  
It uses [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) for LaTeX math typesetting.  
It uses [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) for syntax highlighting in code snippets.
