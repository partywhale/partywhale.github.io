description: Once upon a time there was a fairy godmother named Desiderata who had a good heart, a wise head, and poor planning skillsâ€”which unfortunately left the Princess Emberella in the care of her other (not quite so good and wise) godmother. So now it's up to Magrat Garlick, Granny Weatherwax, and Nanny Ogg to hop on broomsticks and make for far-distant Genua to ensure the servant girl doesn't marry the Prince.
