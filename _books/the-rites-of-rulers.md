author: "Christel Lane"
description: Although considerable attention has been paid to those cultural revolutions which result in fundamental social upheavals, the less spectacular silent cultural revolutions which leave the existing social structure intact, focusing instead on the behavioural dimension of ideology, have been neglected. In this book, Christel Lane examines such a silent revolution, exploring the ways in which it was achieved in the Soviet society of the time through the instrument of ritual.
