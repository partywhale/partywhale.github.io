name: "The World of Wal-Mart"
author: "Nicholas Copeland"
description: This book demonstrates the usefulness of anthropological concepts by taking a critical look at Wal-Mart and the American Dream. Rather than singling Wal-Mart out for criticism, the authors treat it as a product of a socio-political order that it also helps to shape. The book attributes Wal-Mart's success to the failure of American (and global) society to make the Dream available to everyone.
