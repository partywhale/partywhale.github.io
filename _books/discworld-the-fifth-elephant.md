> Vimes had once discussed the Ephebian idea of 'democracy' with Carrot, and had been rather interested in the idea that everyone had a vote until he found out that while he, Vimes, would have a vote, there was no way in the rules that anyone could prevent Nobby Nobs from having one as well. Vimes could see the flaw there straight away.

> He took his hands off the oars and pulled in the mooring rope. If I make a couple of loops, he thought, I can strap the axe onto my back. He had a mental picture of what could happen to a man who plunged into the cauldron below a waterfall with a sharp piece of metal attached to his body.
> GOOD MORNING.
> Vimes blinked. A tall dark robed figure was now sitting in the boat.
> 'Are you Death?'
> IT'S THE SCYTHE, ISN'T IT? PEOPLE ALWAYS NOTICE THE SCYTHE.
> 'I'm going to die?'
> POSSIBLY.
> 'Possibly? You turn up when people are possibly going to die?'
> OH YES. IT'S QUITE THE NEW THING. IT'S BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE.
> 'What's that?'
> I'M NOT SURE.
> 'That's very helpful.'
