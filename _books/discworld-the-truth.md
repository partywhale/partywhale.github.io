> 'And these are your reasons, my lord?'  
> 'Do you think I have others?' said Lord Vetinari. 'My motives, as ever, are entirely transparent.'

> WHO KNOWS WHAT EVIL LURKS IN THE HEART OF MEN?  
> The Death of Rats looked up from the feast of the potato. SQUEAK, he said.  
> Death waved a hand dismissively. WELL, YES, OBVIOUSLY ME, he said. I JUST WONDERED IF THERE WAS ANYONE ELSE.

> William groaned. It was Vimes. Worse, he was smiling, in a humourless predatory way.  
> 'Ah, Mr de Worde,' he said, stepping inside. 'There are several thousand dogs stampeding through the city at the moment. This is an interesting fact, isn't it?'  
> He leaned against the wall and produced a cigar. 'Well, I _say_ dogs,' he said, striking a match on Goodmountain's helmet. '_Mostly_ dogs, perhaps I _should_ say. Some cats. More cats now, in fact, 'cos, hah, there's nothing like a, yes, a tidal wave of dogs, fighting and biting and howling, to sort of, how can I put it, give a city a certain... busyness. Especially underfoot, because - did I mention it? - they're very _nervous_ dogs too. Oh, and did I mention cattle?' he went on, conversationally. 'You know how it is, market day and so on, people are driving the cows and, my goodness, around the corner comes a wall of wailing dogs... Oh, and I forgot about the sheep. And the chickens, although I imagine there's not much left of the chickens now...'  
> He stared at William. 'Anything you feel you want to tell me?' he said.
