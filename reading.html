                                    fell in love with the beauteous princess Flower-in-the-Night, only to have her snatched away, right under his very nose, by a wicked

                                    Sophie lived in the town of Market Chipping, which was in Ingary, a land in which anything could happen, and often did. As her 
                                    younger sisters set out to seek their fortunes, Sophie stayed in her father's hat shop. Which proved most unadventurous, until 
                                    the Witch of the Waste came in to buy a bonnet and turned Sophie into an old lady. Now Sophie must seek her own fortune. Which

                                    and meeting the Witch of the Waste head-on. Which was more than Sophie bargained for...

                                    abandon him. As Glass watches the men flee, he is driven to survive by one all-consuming desire: revenge. With shocking grit

                                    outlaws and priests, soldiers and skinchangers, nobles and slaves, will face seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Some will fail, 
                                    others will grow in the strength of darkness. But in a time of rising restlessness, the tides of destiny and politics will lead 
                                    inevitably to the greatest dance of all.

                                    Of the five contenders for power, one is dead, another in disfavor, and still the wars rage as alliances are made and broken. 
                                    And as opposing forces manoeuver for the final showdown, an army of barbaric wildlings arrives from the outermost limits of 
                                    civilization, accompanied by a horde of mythical Others - a supernatural army of the living dead whose animated corpses are 
                                    unstoppable. As the future of the land hangs in the balance, no one will rest until the Seven Kingdoms have exploded in a

                                    A comet the color of blood and flame cuts across the sky. Two great leaders - Lord Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon - who hold

                                    of the sea. This where it took Doggins on his Awfully Big Adventure: a quest full of magic and flying machines. It took three 
                                    young inventors to the moon (where they may or may not have left a bottle of lemonade) and a caveman on a trip to the dentist.

                                    The sorcerer Alder fears sleep. He dreams of the land of death, of his wife who died young and longs to return to him so much 
                                    that she kissed him across the low stone wall that separates our world from the Dry Land-where the grass is withered, the stars 
                                    never move, and lovers pass without knowing each other. The dead are pulling Alder to them at night. Through him they may free 
                                    themselves and invade Earthsea.

                                    Years ago, they had escaped together from the sinister Tombs of Atuan—she, an isolated young priestess; he, a powerful wizard. 
                                    Now she is a farmer's widow, having chosen for herself the simple pleasures of an ordinary life. And he is a broken old man, 
                                    mourning the powers lost to him through no choice of his own. Once, when they were young, they helped each other at a time of 
                                    darkness and danger and shared an adventure like no other. Now they must join forces again, to help another in need -- the 
                                    physically and emotionally scarred child whose own destiny has yet to be revealed.

                                    Neil Gaiman, long inspired by ancient mythology in creating the fantastical realms of his fiction, presents a bravura rendition of the Norse gods and their 
                                    world from their origin though their upheaval in Ragnarok.

                                    By all accounts, Simon Basset is on the verge of proposing to his best friend’s sister, the lovely—and almost-on-the-shelf—Daphne Bridgerton. 
                                    But the two of them know the truth—it’s all an elaborate plan to keep Simon free from marriage-minded society mothers. And as for Daphne, surely 
                                    she will attract some worthy suitors now that it seems a duke has declared her desirable. But as Daphne waltzes across ballroom after ballroom with Simon, 
                                    it’s hard to remember that their courtship is a complete sham.

                                    Deep in the Chalk, something is stirring. The owls and the foxes can sense it, and Tiffany Aching feels it in her boots. An old enemy is gathering strength. 
                                    This is a time of endings and beginnings, old friends and new, a blurring of edges and a shifting of power. Now Tiffany stands between the light and the dark, 
                                    the good and the bad. As the fairy horde prepares for invasion, Tiffany must summon all the witches to stand with her. To protect the land. <em>Her</em> land.
                                    There will be a reckoning...

                                    It is a truth universally acknowledged that a policeman taking a holiday would barely have had time to open his suitcase before he finds his first corpse. 
                                    Commander Sam Vimes of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch is on holiday in the pleasant and innocent countryside, but not for him a mere body in the wardrobe. There 
                                    are many, many bodies - and an ancient crime more terrible than murder. He is out of his jurisdiction, out of his depth, out of bacon sandwiches, occasionally 
                                    snookered and out of his mind. But never out of guile. Where there is a crime there must be a finding, there must be a chase, and there must be a punishment. 
                                    They say that in the end all sins are forgiven. But not quite all...

                                    When they meet the Lion Aslan, they realize they've been called to a great adventure and bravely join the battle to free Narnia from the Witch's sinister spell.

                                    Polly Perks has to become a boy in a hurry if she wants to find her brother in the army. 
                                    Cutting off her hair and wearing the trousers is easy. Learning to fart and belch in public and walk like an ape takes more time. 
                                    And there’s a war on. There’s always a war on. Polly and he fellow raw recruits are suddenly in the thick of it. 
                                    All they have on their side is the most artful sergeant in the army and a vampire with a lust for coffee. 
                                    Well… they have the Secret. And it’s time to make a stand.

                                    But in Bad Blintz, the little con suddenly goes down the drain. For someone there is playing a different tune and now the rats must learn a new word.

                                    He can remember when people didn’t tell you off for killing dragons. But he can’t always remember, these days, where he put his teeth. 
                                    He’s really not happy about that bit.

                                    (like underwater - how much time does a codfish need?) to places like cities, where there’s never enough time. 
                                    But the construction of the world’s first truly accurate clock starts a race against, well, time for Lu Tze and his apprentice Lobsang Ludd. 
                                    Because it will stop time. And when time stands still, everything stops with it. Then there really is no future.

                                    It is after all every citizen’s right to bear arms to defend what they consider to be their own. Even if it isn’t. 
                                    And in such pressing circumstances, you really shouldn’t let small details like the absence of an army or indeed the money to finance one get in the way of a 
                                    righteous fight with all the attendant benefits of out-and-out nationalism.

                                    There are those who believe and those who don’t. Through the ages, superstition has had its uses. 
                                    Nowhere more so than in the Discworld where it’s helped to maintain the status quo. 
                                    Anything that undermines superstition has to be viewed with some caution. 
                                    There may be consequences, particularly on the last night of the year when the time is turning. 
                                    When those consequences turn out to be the end of the world, you need to be prepared. 
                                    You might even want more standing between you and oblivion than a mere slip of a girl - even if she has looked Death in the face on numerous occasions.

                                    For members of the City Watch, life consists of troubling times, linked together by periods of torpid inactivity. 
                                    Now is one such troubling time. People are being murdered, but there’s no trace of anything alive having been at the crime scene. 
                                    Is there ever a circumstance in which you can blame the weapon not the murderer? Such philosophical questions are not the usual domain of the city’s police, 
                                    but they’re going to have to start learning fast.

                                    There are many who say that the art of diplomacy is an intricate and complex dance. 
                                    There are others who maintain that it’s merely a matter of who carries the biggest stick. 
                                    The oldest and most inscrutable (not to mention heavily fortified) empire on the Discworld is in turmoil, 
                                    brought about by the revolutionary treatise What I did on My Holidays. 
                                    Workers are uniting, with nothing to lose but their water buffaloes; warlords are struggling for power - and what the nation wants, 
                                    to avoid terrible doom for everyone, is a wizard. Rincewind is not the Disc’s premier wizard – in fact, he can’t even spell ‘wizard’ – but no-one 
                                    specified whether competence was an issue. And they do have a very big stick.

                                    Other children get given xylophones. Susan just had to ask her grandfather to take his vest off. Yes. There’s a Death in the family. 
                                    It’s hard to grow up normally when Grandfather rides a white horse and wields a scythe – especially when you have to take over the family business,

                                    The City Watch needs MEN! But what it’s got includes Corporal Carrot (technically a dwarf), Lance-constable Cuddy (really a dwarf), Lance-constable Detritus (a troll), 
                                    Lance-constable Angua (a woman… most of the time) and Corporal Nobbs (disqualified from the human race for shoving). And they need all the help they can get, 
                                    because someone in Ankh-Morpork has been getting dangerous ideas - about crowns and legendary swords, and destiny. 
                                    And the problem with destiny is, of course, that she is not always careful where she points her finger.

                                    Religion is a controversial business in the Discworld. Everyone has their own opinion, and indeed their own gods. 
                                    Who come in all shapes and sizes. In such a competitive environment, there is a pressing need to make one’s presence felt. 
                                    And it’s certainly not remotely helpful to be reduced to be appearing in the form of a tortoise, a manifestation far below god-like status in anyone’s book. 
                                    In such instances, you need an acolyte, and fast. Preferably one who won’t ask too many questions.

                                    and Nanny Ogg to hop on broomsticks and make for far-distant Genua to ensure the servant girl doesn’t marry the Prince.

                                    People might say that reality is a quality that things possess in the same way that they possess weight. 
                                    Sadly alchemists never really held with such a quaint notion. They think that they can change reality, shape it to their own purpose. 
                                    Imagine then the damage that could be wrought if they get their hands on the ultimate alchemy - the invention of motion pictures, the greatest making of illusions.

                                    It’s bad enough being new on the job, but Teppic hasn’t a clue as to what a pharaoh is supposed to do. 
                                    After all, he’s been trained at Ankh-Morpork’s famed assassins’ school, across the sea from the Kingdom of the Sun. 
                                    First, there’s the monumental task of building a suitable resting place for Dad – a pyramid to end all pyramids.

                                    And to top it all off, the adolescent pharaoh discovers deceit, betrayal - not to mention a headstrong handmaiden - at the heart of his realm.

                                    To the consternation of the patrician, Lord Vetinari, a new invention has arrived in Ankh-Morpork, a great clanging monster of a machine that harnesses

                                    early and arrive armed with notepads and very sensible rainwear. Moist von Lipwig is not a man who enjoys hard work - as master of the Post Office, the Mint

                                    However, he does enjoy being alive, which makes a new job offer from Vetinari hard to refuse.

                                    As Death’s apprentice, he’ll have free board and lodging, use of the company horse, and he won’t need time off for family funerals. 
                                    The position is everything Mort thought he’d ever wanted, until he discovers that this perfect job can be a killer on his love life.

                                    This book demonstrates the usefulness of anthropological concepts by taking a critical look at Wal-Mart and the American Dream. 
                                    Rather than singling Wal-Mart out for criticism, the authors treat it as a product of a socio-political order that it also helps to shape. 
                                    The book attributes Wal-Mart’s success to the failure of American (and global) society to make the Dream available to everyone.

                                    Although considerable attention has been paid to those cultural revolutions which result in fundamental social upheavals, 
                                    the less spectacular silent cultural revolutions which leave the existing social structure intact, focusing instead on the behavioural dimension of ideology, 
                                    have been neglected. In this book, Christel Lane examines such a silent revolution, exploring the ways in which it was achieved in the Soviet society of the 
                                    time through the instrument of ritual.

                                    The play ushered in a new social era and “exploded like a bomb into contemporary life”.

                                    Written in 1914 but not published until 1925, a year after Kafka’s death, The Trial is the terrifying tale of Josef K., a respectable bank officer 
                                    who is suddenly and inexplicably arrested and must defend himself against a charge about which he can get no information. 
                                    Whether read as an existential tale, a parable, or a prophecy of the excesses of modern bureaucracy wedded to the madness of totalitarianism,

                                    C. Wright Mills is best remembered for his highly acclaimed work The Sociological Imagination, in which he set forth his views on how social science 
                                    should be pursued. Hailed upon publication as a cogent and hard-hitting critique, The Sociological Imagination took issue with the ascendant schools 
                                    of sociology in the United States, calling for a humanist sociology connecting the social, personal, and historical dimensions of our lives. The sociological 
                                    imagination Mills calls for is a sociological vision, a way of looking at the world that can see links between the apparently private problems of the individual 
                                    and important social issues.

                                    Stephen Hawking’s worldwide bestseller A Brief History of Time remains a landmark volume in scientific writing. 
                                    But for years readers have asked for a more accessible formulation of its key concepts—the nature of space and time, the role of God in creation, 
                                    and the history and future of the universe. A Briefer History of Time is Professor Hawking’s response.

                                    In this brilliant work, the most influential philosopher since Sartre suggests that such vaunted reforms as the abolition of torture and the emergence 
                                    of the modern penitentiary have merely shifted the focus of punishment from the prisoner’s body to his soul.

                                    This classic work by the Russian philosopher and literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin (1895—1975) examines popular humor and folk culture in the Middle Ages 
                                    and the Renaissance, especially the world of carnival, as depicted in the novels of François Rabelais.

                                    An autobiographical work that describes firsthand the great tectonic shifts in English society following the First World War, 
                                    Robert Graves’s Goodbye to All That is a matchless evocation of the Great War’s haunting legacy.
